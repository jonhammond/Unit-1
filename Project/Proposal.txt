I will be designing a web app that generates dancing stick figures for each letter input by the user. Each letter within the alphabet will have a unique dance move, and a corresponding name for that dance move. For example, if you type in the letter 'D', you would suddenly see a stick figure doing 'The Dougie' (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf2mBVcYS10). This will require a lot of time spent animating each stick figure on frame at a time, but I'm cool with that. Each animation will be exported from an application called Stykz, and they will be formatted as .gifs.

I will also be including a feature that allows the user to play music for their dancing stick figures. This will require the use of the Spotify API, and will likely require the use of an API key. I will get the key generated as soon as this project is approved. The Spotify API will allow me to include music on my page, categorized by decade, and will be toggled via buttons. I will also include some easter eggs, ideally where when the user types in a specific name, they get one stick figure with a unique move. For example, the user inputs 'Thriller', they will see a stick figure doing the moves from Michael Jackson's Thriller (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSHgRfMA-_Q).
