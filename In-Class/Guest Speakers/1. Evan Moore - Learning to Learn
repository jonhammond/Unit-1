BEGIN LECTURE

How to be a sponge
  - Objectives
    - Describe a three step process for optimizing your learning potential
    - Identify personal strengths and areas for improvement

  Steps  
    1. Set the Stage - Prime your brain
      a. Clear the stage - Reset your working memory (short-term memory)
        - See "Your Brain at Work" by David Rock
        - First time you expose your brain to information it goes to your working memory
        - Plan shit out
        - Use a task list, get shit done, keep shit out of your short-term memory
        - Clear active and potential distractions
        - Not procrastinating. None of that shit.
      b. Clarify the What and the Why
        - What = your objective
          - Ex: Want to be able to explain CSS after taking Full-Stack
        - Why = your motivation
          - You get more value from something when you know the reason you are doing something
      c. Prioritize process over product - Focused practice is the key
        - Timeblocks
          - Set out time to work specifically on one thing, regardless of whether or not you achieve your goal
          - Frequent practice increases comfortability with approaching and overcoming challenges frequently.

      Summarize each in one sentence
        - Setting the stage: Get shit done. No procrastinating.
        - Clarify the What and the Why: Understand your motivation.
        - Prioritize process over product: Always dedicate time to work on things that are almost too challenging.

    2. Play
      a. Wrestle with it. Strive for fluency. --> Approach something from all angles to achieve fluency.
      - "There is no such thing as intelligence, just familiarity."
      - Comprehension vs. Fluency

      b. Take risks - Cultivate a growth mindset
        - Coursera Course - Learning how to learn
          - Law of serendipity: Fortune favors those who try
        - Be ready to make all of the mistakes along the way

      c. Have fun!
        - If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong.
        - When you're not having fun, you're losing access to your brain's full potential to learn. Positivity = more learning.
        - Check in on yourself - look for signs of body stress, and relax those areas

    3. Reflect - Be your own teacher
      - Self assess. Be honest with yourself. Ask yourself how close did you get? How far did you over-shoot? How do you feel about how much you have done?
      - Ask new questions

Struggling with a subset:
  -Prioritize process over product
    -Symptoms: skipping readings, half-assing homework, not making an effort to accomplish the stretch exercises.
