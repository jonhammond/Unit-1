#Frontend Personal Project
## Project Proposal

### Project Description
A website that generates animated stick figures for each letter of the alphabet based on user input. Each letter is assigned to a different dance move that starts with that letter (i.e. D --> 'The Dougie'). Users will have the ability to play music via the Spotfy API, and watch as their name comes to life!

### Intended Users
Children, adults, old people... anyone and everyone that is easily amused! And the best part is that the user only needs to know how to type, click, and press enter! Want to show grandma what the stanky leg is without having to play her the music video and be victim to her disappointment and judgment? Use this page!

### Outputs?
Outputs will be individual gifs based on the user's input in the form.

### Inputs?
Inputs will be whatever the user chooses to type into the form. Names, sentences, whatever. Some names will even trigger certain events when input. For example, the user inputs "Carlton". Rather than seeing 7 different gifs, the user will see a single gif simulating the dance done by Carlton in The Fresh Prince of Belaire.

### Technologies that I Plan to Use
* HTML,
* CSS and Bootstrap
* JavaScript/JQuery,
* Spotify API
* Local Storage

### Feature list
* Dance Battles
* User-generated gifs
* Spotify music chosen by the user via buttons
* Did I mention GIFs???
* Epic, yet simple entertainment

## Wireframes
* Still a work in progress, trying to determine how to display gifs horizontally if the name is very long.
